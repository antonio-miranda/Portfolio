This notebook shows how to calculate co-localisation between two genes (% of cells expressing both), using Scanpy's scRNAseq anndata object as a base.

To run co-localisation betweeen a large number of genes, this should be ran on a HPC. See "coloc_sub.sh" as an example on how to call the python script for this purpose.
